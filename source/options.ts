	When enabled, ensures that no more than `intervalCap` tasks execute in any rolling `interval` window, rather than resetting the count at fixed intervals. This provides more predictable and evenly distributed execution.

	@default false

	For example, with `intervalCap: 2` and `interval: 1000`:
	- __Default mode (fixed window)__: Tasks can burst at window boundaries. You could execute 2 tasks at 999ms and 2 more at 1000ms, resulting in 4 tasks within 1ms.
	- __Strict mode (sliding window)__: Enforces that no more than 2 tasks execute in any 1000ms rolling window, preventing bursts.

	Strict mode is more resource-intensive as it tracks individual execution timestamps. Use it when you need guaranteed rate-limit compliance, such as when interacting with APIs that enforce strict rate limits.

	The `carryoverIntervalCount` option has no effect when `strict` mode is enabled, as strict mode tracks actual execution timestamps rather than counting pending tasks.
